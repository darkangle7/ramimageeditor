# ramimageeditor

##Main Usage
To Change the resolution/Format of Single or Bunch of Images

###Why did i created this code:
Once i had a bunch of 100 images and each image is of different resolution and i need them in one resolution and also in .png format and this was a time consuming task
So i had created this python code to do it in one shot.

##How to use it 
First clone it in your local system  (PS: Only in windows i lost my original code so sorry for this)

## open the dist folder and run the ram.exe applicaiton and just go with the flow 

Thank you
